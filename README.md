# API Documentation

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Backend deployed at

heroku.com <br>
https://coach-me-backend.herokuapp.com/

---

### Backend framework

-   Node.js and Express gives us the flexibility to control the flow of requests to airtable in a controlled and easy to read environment.
-   We are going to need a database that can be seeded with massive amounts of data and control the relationships between the tables.
-   Custom Middleware
-   prebuilt middleware packages

_Example_

```javascript

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

-   PORT
-   AIRTABLE\*KEY
-   JWT_SECRET

üö´ These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app
_ STAGING_DB - optional development db for using functionality not available in SQLite
_ NODE\*ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"

-   JWT*SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running import random''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;*(-_=+)') for i in range(50)])
    _ SENDGRID_API_KEY - this is generated in your Sendgrid account \* stripe_secret - this is generated in the Stripe dashboard
