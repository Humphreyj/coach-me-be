## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

-   PORT
-   AIRTABLE\*KEY
-   JWT_SECRET

üö´ These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app
_ STAGING_DB - optional development db for using functionality not available in SQLite
_ NODE\*ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"

-   JWT*SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running import random''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;*(-_=+)') for i in range(50)])
    _ SENDGRID_API_KEY - this is generated in your Sendgrid account \* stripe_secret - this is generated in the Stripe dashboard
